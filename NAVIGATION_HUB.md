## Key Navigation Patterns

### Pattern 52: NETWORK OF PATHS
Create a network where every pattern is reachable through multiple paths:
- By number (1-253)
- By category (Towns/Buildings/Construction)
- By sequence (1-36)
- By relationship (broader/narrower)
- By domain (physical/social/conceptual/psychic)

### Pattern 120: PATHS AND GOALS  
Different paths for different goals:
- **Learning path**: Start → sequences → patterns → examples
- **Reference path**: Index → category → pattern
- **Development path**: Code → tests → validation
- **Research path**: Theory → analysis → implementation

### Pattern 31: PROMENADE
Create a pleasant walk through the pattern space:
1. Start at README (overview)
2. Walk through PATTERN_MAP (structure)
3. Choose a sequence in SEQUENCE_NAVIGATION
4. Follow the sequence through patterns
5. Explore related patterns via hypergraph
6. Return to hub for new direction

## Wayfinding Aids

### In Every Region
Each major directory has:
- **README.md**: Regional overview
- **Index files**: Quick reference
- **Examples**: Usage demonstrations
- **Tests**: Validation

### Pattern References
Every pattern document includes:
- **Preceding patterns**: Context and requirements
- **Following patterns**: Next steps and refinements
- **Related patterns**: Alternatives and variations
- **Sequences**: Which flows include this pattern

### Visual Landmarks
Look for these markers:
- ✅ Implemented features
- 🔶 Partial implementations  
- 📋 Planned features
- 🎯 Quick actions
- 🧠 Theory/concepts
- 🔬 Analysis tools

## Finding Your Way

### If you're lost...
1. Return to [README.md](README.md) - The main plaza
2. Check [PATTERN_MAP.md](PATTERN_MAP.md) - Regional map
3. Come back here - Navigation hub
4. Try [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - Command shortcuts

### If you want to explore...
1. Pick an entry point above that matches your interest
2. Follow the path suggested
3. Notice side paths and connections
4. Follow your curiosity
5. Return here when you want a new direction

### If you want to understand deeply...
1. Read patterns in sequence order
2. Notice the emergent phenomena
3. See how patterns reinforce each other
4. Try applying patterns yourself
5. Observe the meta-recursive structure

## Cognitive Navigation Principles

### Pattern 31: PROMENADE
- Navigation should be pleasant and revealing
- Every path should teach something
- Dead ends should be avoided
- Return paths should be clear

### Pattern 106: POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE  
- Every region should have clear boundaries
- Entrances should be obvious
- Purpose should be immediately apparent

### Pattern 112: ENTRANCE TRANSITION
- Ease into complex topics gradually
- Provide orientation at transitions
- Mark boundaries between regions

## Next Steps

**Choose your path**:
- → [README.md](README.md) for overview
- → [PATTERN_MAP.md](PATTERN_MAP.md) for structure
- → [SEQUENCE_NAVIGATION.md](SEQUENCE_NAVIGATION.md) for guided tours *(to be created)*
- → [Pattern Index](PATTERN_INDEX.md) for direct access *(to be created)*
- → [docs/](docs/) for theory and specifications

## Contributing Navigation Improvements

The navigation structure itself follows Pattern 253: THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE—it should grow organically based on actual use. Suggest improvements:
- New entry points for different user types
- Better wayfinding within regions
- Clearer connections between patterns
- More helpful landmarks and signposts

**Meta-Pattern Note**: This navigation hub is itself an application of Pattern 28 (Eccentric Nucleus) and Pattern 31 (Promenade), demonstrating how patterns can be applied to information architecture. The hub is deliberately "eccentric"—off to one side rather than hierarchically central—allowing multiple entry points and respecting different cognitive styles.

*Navigate by interest, not by hierarchy. Explore by curiosity, not by mandate.*
