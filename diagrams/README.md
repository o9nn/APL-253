# Pattern Language Diagrams

This directory contains Mermaid (`.mmd`) diagrams visualizing the Pattern Language architecture and relationships.

## Diagrams Overview

| Diagram | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pattern-language-hierarchy.mmd` | Overall hierarchy showing the three main categories (Towns, Buildings, Construction) |
| `pattern-sequences.mmd` | The 36 pattern sequences and their flow from Towns through Construction |
| `domain-transformations.mmd` | How archetypal patterns transform across four domains (Physical, Social, Conceptual, Psychic) |
| `architecture-layers.mmd` | System architecture showing Presentation, Integration, Processing, and Foundation layers |
| `pattern-relationships.mmd` | Types of relationships between patterns (hierarchy, sequence, dependency, emergence) |
| `placeholder-system.mmd` | The 10 core placeholders and how they map to domain-specific terms |
| `data-flow.mmd` | Data pipeline from source files through generators to output formats |
| `cognitive-affordances.mmd` | Mind map of cognitive affordances for "optimal grip" on pattern language |
